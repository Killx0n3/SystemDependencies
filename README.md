# System Dependencies
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Java-orange.svg)
## Project Details 
Components of computer systems often have dependenciesâ€”other components that must be in- stalled before they will function properly. These dependencies are frequently shared by multiple components. For example, both the TELNET client program and the FTP client program require that the TCP/IP networking software be installed before they can operate. If you install TCP/IP and the TELNET client program, and later decide to add the FTP client program, you do not need to reinstall TCP/IP.
For some components it would not be a problem if the components on which they depended were reinstalled; it would just waste some resources. But for others, like TCP/IP, some component configuration may be destroyed if the component was reinstalled.
It is useful to be able to remove components that are no longer needed. When this is done, components that only support the removed component may also be removed, freeing up disk space, memory, and other resources. But a supporting component, not explicitly installed, may be removed only if all components which depend on it are also removed. For example, removing the FTP client program and TCP/IP would mean the TELNET client program, which was not removed, would no longer operate. Likewise, removing TCP/IP by itself would cause the failure of both the TELNET and the FTP client programs. Also if we installed TCP/IP to support our own development, then installed the TELNET client (which depends on TCP/IP) and then still later removed the TELNET client, we would not want TCP/IP to be removed.
This program will automate the process of adding and removing components. To do this we will maintain a record of installed components and component dependencies. A component can be installed explicitly in response to a command (unless it is already installed), or implicitly if it is needed for some other component being installed. Likewise, a component, not explicitly installed, can be explicitly removed in response to a command (if it is not needed to support other components) or implicitly removed if it is no longer needed to support another component.
